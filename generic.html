							<strong>Why Information Technology?</strong>
							<div style="color:#EED2DC;">I have no idea...</div>
							Sounds funny... I know!! 
							At first, I wanted to become a Doctor, maybe that's because I didn't really know what I want or what I am really interested in; however, my GPA didn't help. So later, I thought that Information Technology revolves around coding but unfortunately I was wrong again. 
							That's negative I know, but hold on, read through... I have a point. You see, maybe IT wasn't my thing, but I don't regret it at all because in college, I took a course in programming Java, and that gave me a completely new interest which is basically coding. After that door closed, I started to discover many many new things. After I get my diploma in Information technology, I will change my major to Psychology and continue to enchance my skills in programming. That might seem weird, but with time, I got to know what I really want and what I am interested about.
