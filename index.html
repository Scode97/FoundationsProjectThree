							<p> 
								The headline, in short, illustrates my path along with learning, practicing, and enhancing my own coding skills. My interest in coding evolved once I started creating different programs back in high school. Irrespective of the fact that the programs we worked on were easy, <span style="color:#ede6e6">I felt that I can express myself</span> and <span style="color:#ede6e6">my creativity through making up certain codings.</span> I believed, since the very start, that practice is what will make me succeed although I found the majority just memorizing the rules, different structures, algorithms, etc. Ever since then, I started researching and reading different concepts correlated with coding using different languages including Java, HTML, CSS etc. This further made me link Java to an back-end application; namely, SQL.<br> 

								What made me hold on through coding is that through it you come up with many restrictions, and you try your level best to solve (debug) each and every error, and by that:<br> <span style="color:#ed9489; display: center;">I learnt that one error is not just limited to one solution; there are many solutions that literaly lead to the exact same output.<br><br>
								<strong>The same goes on with life, when one door closes, and the other one closes, and the other one closes, there is a door right there that's open, hold on, be patient, it is right there, you got to change your path, if not, change your point of view about it.</strong>
